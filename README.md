# Email-System-By-Python

This miniproject has a GUI attached to it, you only have to import the image given and then reattach it to the GUI with just copying the file path.
This system has been created by using SMTP libraries available in python and you can analyze all of them easily.

The above is a temporary interface and should be modified.

For the mail password you can refer to the video given below:

Just know how to get that app password, then copy it and just paste it in the mail password inside the code.
Remember that the mail password should be of the same email id which you are using in the system.

The interface in the above project may not be satisfactory by as time follows... Further updates will surely be done in this project.
